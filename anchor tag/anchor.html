<p>The list-style-image property in CSS is used to specify a custom image to be used as the marker 
    for a list item. However, it does not allow direct specification of the image's width and height. 
    To resize the image, you need to edit the image file itself or use a different CSS approach,   
    such as using background-image and background-size properties. By setting background-size, you c
    an control the dimensions of the image, making it a useful workaround for resizing
     list item markers.
